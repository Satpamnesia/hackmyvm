## searching victim's ip address in my LAN network
![image](https://github.com/Satpamnesia/hackmyvm.eu/assets/44630640/dd9a8a04-9664-4654-948a-d5b95e7bf0f2)

lets grab the ip addresses using regex with `grep`.

and, here we go.

## passive recon
*i wanna tell something that i hate the new name of reconnaissance, footprinting is suck :>*

here is my `nmap` result that scanned using `rustscan` for the fastest version. i also do `nmap` if `rustscan` has lack when doing scan. i wont share what commands i used for pentest, because, internet has large of resources to obtain from. (selfish time).

i do evilscan (simply like `nc -zv $victim 1-65535`) as well.

well, there must be static site running on 80 port as always. and lets see how the site looks like.

## 80/tcp

just a simple AVI to MP4 conversion site. nothing interesting, but here i got a domain name for the site after uploading `.avi`.

i will put it on `/etc/hosts`.

i wanna record the website behavior to my burpsuite. ill be back after bruteforcing the site's directory.

## directory iteration

i did bruteforce to the directory using the fabulous automation, named it `feroxbuster`. preatty easy to use.

as you seen in the picture above, there bunch of interesting directory to explore around such as, `sitemap.xml`, `login.php`, `upload.php`, etc. 

## command injection found
since this website created as mp4 conversion, and file upload thing. i fired up my browser and looked for the vulnerability, then i found this

i had to try that thing with burpsuite and rename the `filename` parameter to ping my local machine and have a test with `tcpdump` if the command injection works.

and i dont know why the response comes back bringing bunch of pings to the local machine, lets make our reverse shell to get into the system.

## shell as www-data
put the reverse shell down on `filename` parameter, and then send the request.

after that the shell comes up with the user as `www-data`.
